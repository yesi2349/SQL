I used this SQL to query a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics on customer and order data

#1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many iPhones were sold in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product=IPhone

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#4. What was the price of the cheapest product sold in January?

SELECT MIN(price),product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 

SELECT product, price, sum(quantity)*price as Revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSalesGroup by product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT product, quantity, price, location, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as Feb
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
Group by product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum) as customers, AVG(price*quantity) as AVG_Spent FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers as cust
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE Feb.quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND  orderID <> 'Order ID'
